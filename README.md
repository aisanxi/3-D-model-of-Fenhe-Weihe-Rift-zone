The digital data
1. station.lst contains station distribution information. Every line records station name, longitude, latitude successively.
2. grid_inv.lst is the grid on which we built the 3-D model. Every line records grid name, longitude, latitude successively.
3. ph/gp contain the phase and group velocities in files such as dt_700_60_30_10.1, in which 10 denotes the period.
4. stacked_cross-correlation contains the stacked ambient noise cross-correlations.
5. The final 3-D model and associated uncertainties are located in 3-D_Vs_model_error.
