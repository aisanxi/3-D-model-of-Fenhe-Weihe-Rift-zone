The digital data are listed as follows:
1. station.lst contains station distribution information. Every line records station name, longitude, latitude successively.
2. grid_inv.lst contains the grid on which we built the 3-D model. Every line records grid name, longitude, latitude successively.
3. Directories ph/gp contain the phase and group velocities in files such as dt_700_60_30_10.1, in which 10 denotes the period.
4. stacked_cross-correlation.1/2/3/4 contain the stacked ambient noise cross-correlations.
5. The final 3-D model and associated uncertainties are contained in  3-D_Vs_model_error.tgz.
