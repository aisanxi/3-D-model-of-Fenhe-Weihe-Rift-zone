1. grid_inv.lst is the grid on which we built the 3-D model. Every line has station name, longitude, latitude successively.
2. ph/gp contain the phase and group velocities in files such as dt_700_60_30_10.1, in which 10 denote the period.
3. stacked_cross-correlation contains the stacked ambient noise cross-correlations.
4. The final 3-D model and associated uncertainties are located in 3-D_Vs_model_error.
